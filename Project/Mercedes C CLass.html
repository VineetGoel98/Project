            <p style="margin-left:280px;margin-right:260px;">The C-Class also stands for an attitude: it needs no attention – but pays all the more attention. Its innovative and foresighted systems keep track of everything and if necessary it reminds you when calmness could turn into drowsiness. It is totally without fuss and effortlessly superior.

            <b>Very expensive and still not very large, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class nonetheless leads its luxury niche with fabulous style and fantastic power and grip.</b><br>
            The 2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class has one of the finest cabins at its price point, helping it achieve a top-half ranking in a very competitive segment. However, the C-Class' low predicted reliability rating and largely forgettable performance prevent it from rising any higher.<br>
            With a striking profile in any body style, the 2018 C-Class drops some S-Class references on its way to a distinctive profile. It swings the taste scale wildly from illuminated logos to discrete LED running lights to its abbreviated tail. It’s unabashedly gorgeous inside, with its waterfall console slathered in wood or aluminum, its big round vents—even with the misstep of a tacked-on digital display.<br>

                There have been some changes to standard and optional equipment across the C-Class lineup, and Mercedes has simplified some options packages and stand-alone options. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now available in the C-Class, too. A plug-in hybrid, the C350e, is essentially new, though it technically debuted very late in the 2017 model year. Finally, the base C300 now has a nine-speed automatic transmission instead of last year's seven-speed auto.<br>
                A low-volume plug-in hybrid version adds a small battery pack and a plug in the rear bumper, but its green credentials are muted: it only delivers 8 miles of EPA-rated continuous electric range and combined fuel economy that’s only about 10 percent higher.

                <p><b>Coupes are best to our eyes, but the 2018 Mercedes C-Class family doesn’t have any member they’d Photoshop out of holiday pics.</p></b>
                <p>Whether a convertible, a coupe, or a sedan, the C-Class takes the best cues from the Mercedes family stylebook, and wraps them around a sleek interior that fairly glows with good taste.The LED lines over the headlights frame the front end nicely along with large low-set air intakes. The streamlined nose blends into slightly flared fenders, on back to the softly curved tail.</p>
                In profile, the C-Class bears a strong resemblance to larger Mercedes sedans, but its shorter body and abbreviated trunk distinguish it from those cars, not to mention from angular ATS sedans and other rivals.

                <p>The 2018 Mercedes C-Class can bend to the road ahead, or it can warp your mind.</p>
                <p>The C-Class starts as a C300, in any body style. The 2.0-liter turbo-4 under its hood churns out 241 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque, and this year it teams with a new 9-speed automatic. Mercedes says its 0-60 mph times fall by a couple of ticks to 5.8 seconds, but what’s harder to describe is how light-footed even the base Benz C300 feels. It’s blessed with some of the whizzy, wonderful feel of the small CLA45 AMG, with lots of low-end boost and instant-on power. The crackly exhaust isn’t there, and neither is the high-rev frenzy, but the C300 pulls strongly for what’s ostensibly a base model, and sends power to either the rear or all four wheels.</p>

                <p>Each comes with a choice of turbo-4, turbo V-6, or turbo V-8 engines, rear- or all-wheel drive, and each comes with an automatic transmission.
                  
                    Beyond that dazzling display of niche-marketing firepower, the C-Class also has an excellent set of standard and optional features, and great customization potential. Its infotainment system puzzles us, and its 4-year/50,000-mile warranty is solid, but outdone by rivals.Standard features include cruise control, power features, a power driver seat, a rearview camera, a 7.0-inch display with touchpad-based infotainment control, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and a USB port. Sedans and coupes also get a sunroof, and two-doors get 18-inch wheels and wood trim.</p>
                    The custom-dress kits include nappa leather, sport seats, AMG-style wheels and bodywork, and choice of metal, leather, and wood trim.

                All C-Class cars get a rearview camera and a driver knee airbag. Forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking also are included on all models. Options include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, and active lane control systems that can follow vehicles ahead of the C-Class in traffic and can apply the car’s brakes to correct lane drift.Surround-view cameras, active park assist, and a head-up display are also on the option list.
