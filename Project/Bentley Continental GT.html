            <p style="margin-left:280px;margin-right:260px;">With a completely new 6.0 litre, twin-turbocharged W12 engine, a step-change in technology and a truly stunning design language, the new Continental GT is unmatched in its class. This Bentley GT coupé is the quintessential grand tourer – phenomenally powerful, beautifully designed and exquisitely crafted.</p>

                <p><b>Reduced to just the convertible and the W-12, the 2018 Bentley Continental GT is still elegant, fast, and fashionable.</b></p>With a replacement coupe and convertible on the way, beginning in 2019, the original Continental GT finally gets to take a rest. On the road since the mid-2000s, the current Conti GT is a bruiser of a two-door grand tourer, still graced with W-12 power, even while its V-8 version drops off radar.<br>
                It looks rather like the old Continental GT and has a surprisingly similar on-paper spec, complete with unusual (and compact) twin turbo 6.0-litre W12 engine. Yet the third generation of Bentley Continental GT is all new. What’s more, it feels new – and a whole lot better than the old bruiser.The Continental is a big car that weighs close to three tons, but it wears its heft well and looks trimmer than it is. It has the style of a classic grand touring car, with rounded, soft lines and round headlights offset by the sharpness of its side character lines.

                    The old Continental GT used an adapted version of the VW Phaeton platform. It was finely tuned and cleverly fettled, and always felt as solid as a bank vault. But when the roads got winding and the speeds got high, it felt more big saloon than two-door coupé.<br>This new architecture – some components are shared with the Porsche Panamera – was co-developed by Bentley from the beginning. The Crewe engineers got what they wanted, not what was available.<br>
                    Soft curves flow around the edges, with a sharp character line starting at the front wheels and flowing back to the rear wheels. Another sharp line picks up front there, defining the pronounced rear haunches. It’s a clean, harmonious, and, above all, beautiful look that has stood up over time.The center console divides the cockpit and features an 8.0-inch screen. The wood is bookmatched to provide a consistent appearance.

                    The engine is now 150mm further back (the old charmer was always nose-heavy). There’s four-wheel drive, as before, but the split is more rear-biased, improving handling and agility. We find four big air springs, which give astonishing suppleness. Bentley’s clever 48V electronic anti-roll system boosts ride suppleness and helps give superb body control. It similar to the system used on the Bentayga, and is a key reason why that top-heavy SUV handles with extraordinary élan.The 2018 Bentley Continental lineup of droptops consists of just the GT, GT Speed, and, new for 2018, the Supersports. All have the W-12 engine, but it is offered in three states of tune. It makes 568 horsepower in the GT, 615 in the GT Speed, and 700 in the Supersports.

                    A 2.2 tonne-plus car has no right to be this fast. Use the launch control – a sign of the car’s sporting ambitions – and you can sprint to 60 from rest in a breathless 3.6 seconds, the big W12 punching hard, the front tyres pawing at the tarmac to aid traction, and your innards trying to punch a hole through the backrest. Top speed is 207mph. It’s supercar fast, and feels it.<br>
                    The 2018 Bentley Continental is capable on twisty roads despite its considerable weight and its W-12 engine moves this car with authority.In the GT Speed it makes 615 hp and launches the car from 0-60 mph around four seconds on its way to a top speed above 190 mph.The new Supersports makes a whopping 700 hp; Bentley has not shared its performance numbers.
